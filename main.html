    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input,which gives the idea about how efficient the algorithm can work.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> of some linked list operations mentioned above is O(1) because they do not require extra space beyond a fixed number of variables. However, for certain operations, extra space of the order of O(n) may be needed</p>
